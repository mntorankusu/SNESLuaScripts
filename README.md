# SNESLuaScripts
Lua scripts to add modern controls to SNES games. Currently only Wild Guns.

This is a project that I originally started to add analog controls to old racing games. I wanted to play them with a steering wheel. Then I got sidetracked and started adding mouse controls to old shooting games. The analog controls for racing games thing was hit-or-miss, but mouse control was a pretty great success. It's especially nice to have now because you can use it with things like the Sinden Light Gun and Oculus Quest 2 (using Virtual Desktop), which didn't exist when I made this script. 

There's this whole UDP server thing that allows you to use an Xinput controller to get analog controller data into the script, which I haven't released yet. It was a poorly-made proprietary thing that I never really got into a good state. I would rather get it working with the CemuHook standard UDP thing that everyone is using now.

These things were all secretly in a public repository on GitHub for a long time, though I never told anyone, and eventually completely forgot about it myself. People kept asking me to release it but I thought I needed to search my old backups and didn't feel like doing it. Oops.

I made a patreon for this project here if you want to give me a dollar: https://www.patreon.com/mntorankusu
